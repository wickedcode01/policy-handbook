## 1. Overview

This Mobile Device Management (MDM) Policy outlines the security requirements and guidelines for using mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) to access [Company Name]'s data, systems, or networks. It covers both company-issued and employee-owned (BYOD) devices. The policy aims to protect company information and minimize security risks associated with mobile device usage.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:

*   Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company data accessed from mobile devices.
*   Minimize the risk of security breaches and data loss related to mobile device usage.
*   Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.
*   Establish clear guidelines for secure mobile device usage.
*   Provide a framework for managing and securing both company-issued and employee-owned devices.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

*   **All Mobile Devices:** Smartphones, tablets, and other portable computing devices that access company data, systems, or networks.
*   **Company-Issued Devices:** Mobile devices owned and provided by [Company Name].
*   **Employee-Owned Devices (BYOD):** Personally owned devices used to access company resources.
*   **Covered Data:** Any company data accessed, stored, or transmitted on mobile devices, including email, documents, contacts, and other information.
*   **All Personnel:** Employees, contractors, and vendors who use mobile devices to access company resources.

## 4. Policy

### 4.1. Device Enrollment (with MDM)

*   **If [Company Name] utilizes a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution:** All mobile devices (both company-issued and employee-owned) that access company data or systems *must* be enrolled in the MDM system.
*   The MDM system will enforce security policies, including:
    *   Passcode requirements.
    *   Encryption requirements.
    *   Application restrictions.
    *   Remote wipe capabilities.
    *   Other security settings as determined by the IT Support Provider.

### 4.2. Device Requirements (without MDM)

*   **If [Company Name] does *not* utilize a formal MDM solution:** The following minimum security requirements apply to *all* mobile devices (both company-issued and employee-owned) that access company data or systems:
    *   **Passcode/PIN:** A strong passcode or PIN (at least 6 characters, preferably alphanumeric) must be used to lock the device.
    *   **Screen Lock:** The device must automatically lock after a short period of inactivity (no more than 5 minutes).
    *   **Encryption:** Device encryption must be enabled (if supported by the device).
    *   **Operating System Updates:** The device's operating system must be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Application Updates:** All applications on the device must be kept up-to-date.
    *   **Antivirus/Anti-malware:** If available for the device platform, up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware software must be installed and active.
    *   **Remote Wipe Capability:** If supported by the device, remote wipe capability must be enabled. This allows the company to remotely erase company data if the device is lost or stolen.
    *   **"Jailbreaking" or "Rooting" Prohibited:** Modifying the device's operating system to bypass security restrictions ("jailbreaking" on iOS or "rooting" on Android) is strictly prohibited.

### 4.3. Acceptable Use

*   Sensitive company data should be stored on the device only when absolutely necessary.
*   Users should avoid storing sensitive data on removable storage (e.g., SD cards) unless it is encrypted.
*   Users must be cautious about connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. A company-approved VPN should be used when accessing sensitive data over public Wi-Fi.

### 4.5. Lost or Stolen Devices

*   Lost or stolen devices must be reported to the [IT Support Provider/Office Manager] immediately.
*   The IT Support Provider (or the user, if remote wipe is enabled) will attempt to remotely wipe company data from the device.

### 4.6. Termination of Employment/Contract
