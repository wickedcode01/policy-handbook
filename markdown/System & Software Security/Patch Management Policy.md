It aims to minimize vulnerabilities and protect against known exploits. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and vendors who manage or use company IT resources.

## 2. Purpose

*   Ensure that systems and applications are running secure and supported versions.
*   Maintain system stability and performance.
*   Comply with relevant security standards and regulations.

## 4. Policy

### 4.1. Patching Schedule

*   [Company Name] will follow a regular patching schedule to ensure that updates are applied in a timely manner.
*   **Critical Security Patches:**  Must be applied within 7 days of release.
*   **High-Priority Patches:**  Must be applied within 14 days of release.
*   **Routine Patches:**  Must be applied within 30 days of release.
*   The IT Support Provider will determine the criticality and priority of patches based on vendor advisories and industry best practices.

### 4.2. Patch Testing

*   Where feasible, patches will be tested in a non-production environment before being deployed to production systems. [For a small company, this might involve testing on a single representative workstation before rolling out the patch to all computers.]
*   Testing will help to identify any potential compatibility issues or adverse effects.

### 4.3. Patch Deployment

*   The IT Support Provider is responsible for deploying patches to company systems and devices.
*   Automated patch management tools will be used where feasible to streamline the patching process.

*   Any exceptions must be documented and approved by the [IT Support Provider/Designated Security Officer].
*   Compensating controls must be implemented to mitigate the risk associated with unpatched vulnerabilities.

### 4.5. Verification

*   The IT Support Provider will verify that patches have been successfully applied.
*   Regular vulnerability scans will be conducted to identify any unpatched systems or applications.

### 4.6. Mobile Devices

* Mobile devices that connect to company systems or access company data must also be kept up to date with the latest security patches. The use of an MDM can help to ensure compliance.

## 5. Responsibilities
