**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** March 18, 2025

## 1. Overview

This Data Encryption and Key Management Policy establishes the requirements for encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, and for securely managing encryption keys. It aims to protect the confidentiality and integrity of [Company Name]'s data and comply with relevant regulations and security standards. This policy applies to all employees, contractors and vendors.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:

*   Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, both at rest and in transit.
*   Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.
*   Establish secure procedures for generating, storing, using, and destroying encryption keys.
*   Comply with relevant data protection regulations and security standards.
*   Minimize the risk of data breaches and data loss.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

*   **Data at Rest:** Sensitive data stored on company-owned or controlled systems, including servers, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, removable media, and cloud storage.
*   **Data in Transit:** Sensitive data transmitted over networks, including internal networks, external networks, and the internet.
*   **Encryption Keys:** All cryptographic keys used to encrypt and decrypt data.
*   **Covered Data:** This policy applies to data classified as "Confidential" or "Restricted" as per the company's Data Classification & Handling Policy. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Customer personal information (names, addresses, Social Security numbers, etc.)
    *   Financial data (bank account numbers, credit card information)
    *   Employee personal information
    *   Trade secrets and intellectual property
    *   Project bids and contracts

## 4. Policy

### 4.1. Encryption Standards

*   [Company Name] will use industry-standard encryption algorithms and protocols.
*   **For data at rest:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key size of 256 bits is the preferred standard.
*   **For data in transit:** TLS (Transport Layer Security) version 1.2 or higher is the preferred standard.
*   Other encryption algorithms and protocols may be used only with the approval of the IT Support Provider.

### 4.2. Data at Rest Encryption

*   Full-disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault) must be enabled on all company-owned laptops and other portable devices.
*   Sensitive data stored on servers must be encrypted.
*   Sensitive data stored on removable media (e.g., USB drives) must be encrypted.
*   Sensitive data stored in cloud services must be encrypted.

### 4.3. Data in Transit Encryption

*   All sensitive data transmitted over public networks (e.g., the internet) must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
*   Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SFTP, FTPS) must be used for transferring sensitive data.
*   Email containing sensitive data must be encrypted.

### 4.4. Key Management

*   **Key Generation:** Encryption keys must be generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
*   **Key Storage:**
    *   Encryption keys must be stored securely, separate from the data they protect.
    *   Keys must be protected from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.
    *   Keys must *never* be stored in plain text on the same system as the encrypted data.
*   **Key Access:** Access to encryption keys must be restricted to authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis.
*   **Key Rotation:** Encryption keys must be rotated periodically (at least annually, or more frequently for highly sensitive data).
*   **Key Backup and Recovery:**  A secure backup and recovery mechanism must be in place for encryption keys.
*   **Key Destruction:**  When encryption keys are no longer needed, they must be securely destroyed using methods that prevent recovery.

### 4.5. Responsibilities

*   **IT Support Provider:** Is responsible for implementing and maintaining encryption solutions and key management procedures.
*   **All Personnel:** Are responsible for complying with this policy and protecting encryption keys to which they have access.

## 5. Compliance

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract, and potential legal action.
