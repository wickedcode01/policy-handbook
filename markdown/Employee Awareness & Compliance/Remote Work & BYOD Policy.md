*   Minimize the risk of security breaches and data loss associated with remote work and BYOD.
*   Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

## 4. Policy

### 4.2. Security Requirements for Remote Work

*   **VPN:**  A company-approved Virtual Private Network (VPN) must be used when accessing sensitive company data or systems from a remote location.

    *   Antivirus/anti-malware software.
    *   Software updates and patching.
    *   Host-based firewall.

### 4.3. Security Requirements for BYOD
