### 4.1. Access Control Principles

*   **Least Privilege:** Users should be granted only the minimum necessary access rights required to perform their job duties.
*   **Need-to-Know:** Access to sensitive information should be restricted to individuals who have a legitimate business need to access it.
*   **Separation of Duties:**  Critical tasks should be divided among multiple individuals to prevent any single person from having complete control and the potential for abuse. (This may be challenging in a very small company, but should be considered where possible.)
*   **Accountability:** All access to company resources should be traceable to individual users.

### 4.2. User Account Management

*   **Account Creation:** New user accounts will be created only upon proper authorization from [Designated Authority - e.g., Office Manager, Owner].
*   **Unique User IDs:** Each user will be assigned a unique user ID.
*   **Password Policy:**  All users must adhere to the company's password policy, which includes requirements for password complexity, length, and expiration.  (See Section 4.3)
*   **Account Review:** User accounts and access rights will be reviewed regularly (at least annually) to ensure they are still appropriate.
*   **Account Deactivation:**  User accounts will be deactivated promptly when an employee leaves the company, a contract ends, or access is no longer needed.
* **Account Lockout:** Accounts will be automatically locked after a specified number of failed login attempts.

### 4.3. Password Policy

*   **Complexity:** Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   **Length:** Passwords must be at least [Number] characters long.  (Recommendation: 8 or more)
*   **Expiration:** Passwords must be changed every [Number] days. (Recommendation: 90 days)
*   **History:**  Users cannot reuse previous passwords. (Recommendation: Remember at least the last 5 passwords)
*   **Prohibited Passwords:**  Users must not use easily guessable passwords, such as their name, username, birthdate, or common words.

### 4.4. Access Authorization

*   Access to specific systems, applications, and data will be granted based on job roles and responsibilities.
*   Requests for access must be submitted to [Designated Authority] and approved before access is granted.
*   Access rights will be documented and maintained.

### 4.5. Remote Access

*   Remote access to company resources will be granted only to authorized users and through secure methods (e.g., VPN).
*   Remote access devices must comply with company security policies (e.g., endpoint security, password protection).

### 4.6. Physical Access Control

*   Physical access to company facilities will be restricted to authorized personnel.
*   Visitors must be escorted by authorized personnel.
*   Access to sensitive areas (e.g., server rooms) will be further restricted and monitored.
