## 1. Overview

This Log Management and Monitoring Policy defines the requirements for collecting, storing, reviewing, and responding to security-related logs from [Company Name]'s information systems and network devices. It aims to ensure that logs are available for security monitoring, incident investigation, troubleshooting, and compliance purposes.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:

*   Enable the detection of security incidents and suspicious activity.
*   Provide an audit trail of system and user activity.
*   Support incident response and investigation efforts.
*   Facilitate troubleshooting of system and network problems.
*   Comply with relevant regulatory requirements and security standards.
*   Improve overall security posture by providing visibility into system and network activity.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all information systems, network devices, and applications owned, leased, or controlled by [Company Name], including:

*   **Servers:**  File servers, application servers, database servers, email servers.
*   **Network Devices:**  Routers, switches, firewalls, wireless access points.
*   **Endpoints:**  Desktops, laptops, mobile devices (to the extent that logging is feasible).
*   **Applications:**  Business applications, security applications.
*   **Cloud Services:** Logs generated by cloud-based services used by the company.

## 4. Policy

### 4.1. Log Generation

*   All systems and devices within the scope of this policy must be configured to generate appropriate security logs.
*   Logs should capture events such as:
    *   Successful and failed login attempts.
    *   Changes to user accounts and permissions.
    *   System configuration changes.
    *   Security policy violations.
    *   Firewall activity (allowed and blocked connections).
    *   Antivirus/anti-malware detections.
    *   Application errors and crashes.
    *   Data access and modification (where feasible and appropriate).
    *   System startup and shutdown.

### 4.2. Log Content

*   Logs should include the following information, where available:
    *   Date and time of the event.
    *   User ID or account associated with the event.
    *   Source IP address and port.
    *   Destination IP address and port.
    *   Type of event.
    *   Description of the event.
    *   Result of the event (success or failure).

### 4.3. Log Storage and Retention

*   Logs must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.
*   Logs should be stored in a centralized location.  For this small construction company, this will likely be a secure folder on a designated server, or a secure cloud-based logging service provided by their IT support provider.
*   Logs must be retained for a minimum of 180 days.
*   Log storage capacity should be sufficient to accommodate the required retention period.

### 4.4. Log Review

*   Logs must be reviewed regularly for suspicious activity and security events.
*   The IT support provider (or the Office Manager if IT support is handled internally) is responsible for reviewing logs.
*   Logs from critical systems (servers, firewalls) will be reviewed at least weekly. Logs from less critical systems (workstations) will be reviewed at least monthly, or as triggered by alerts.
*   Automated log analysis tools will be used where feasible. This will likely be a feature provided by the IT support provider, or a basic script to identify common security events.

### 4.5. Alerting

*   Automated alerting for critical security events will be implemented if feasible. This will likely be a feature provided by the IT support provider.
*   Alerts will be sent to the IT support provider and the Office Manager immediately.
*   Alert thresholds will be configured to minimize false positives.  Initial thresholds will be set based on best practices, and adjusted over time as needed.

### 4.6. SIEM Integration (Optional)

*   If [Company Name] utilizes a managed security service that includes SIEM capabilities, logs will be integrated with the SIEM for centralized monitoring and analysis. The SIEM will be configured to generate alerts for critical security events, and those alerts will be sent to the IT support provider and the Office Manager.

### 4.7. Clock Synchronization

*   All systems and devices must be synchronized to a reliable time source (an NTP server) to ensure the accuracy of log timestamps. The IT support provider will be responsible for configuring and maintaining clock synchronization.

## 5. Compliance

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action.
