### 4.1. Network Access Control

*   Access to the company network will be granted only to authorized users and devices.
*   Strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., passwords, multi-factor authentication) will be used to verify user identity.
*   Network segmentation will be implemented, where feasible, to limit the impact of security breaches. (This might be limited in a small company, but consider separating guest Wi-Fi from the main network).

*   Guest Wi-Fi access, if provided, will be separate from the internal company network and have restricted access.

### 4.2. Firewall Management

### 4.3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention

*   [Intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) may be implemented, depending on the company's size and risk profile. If not feasible, consider using a managed security service provider (MSSP) that offers this.]

### 4.4. Remote Access

### 4.5. Network Monitoring

*   Network traffic will be monitored for suspicious activity.
*   Network performance will be monitored to identify potential problems.
*   Logs from network devices will be collected and analyzed.

### 4.6. Vulnerability Management

*   Regular vulnerability scans will be conducted to identify security weaknesses in network devices and systems.
*   Identified vulnerabilities will be addressed promptly through patching or other mitigation measures.

### 4.7. Wireless Security

*   Strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3) will be used for all wireless networks.
*   Default wireless network names (SSIDs) and passwords will be changed.
