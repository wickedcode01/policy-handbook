## 4. Policy

### 4.1. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

*   A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) has been conducted (or will be conducted) to identify critical business functions, their dependencies, and the potential impact of disruptions.  *(Note: For a small company, this might be a less formal process than for a large enterprise, but the core concept still applies.)*
*   The BIA will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if there are significant changes to the business.
* The BIA identified the following as critical business functions:
  * [List critical functions like Project Management, Client Communication, Payroll, Bidding/Estimating, Invoicing, etc.]
*   For each critical function, the BIA determined:
    *   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**  The maximum acceptable time that the function can be unavailable. *[e.g., Payroll: 24 hours]*
    *   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss. *[e.g., Project Files: 4 hours]*

### 4.2. Recovery Strategies

*   Based on the BIA, the following recovery strategies have been developed:
    *   **Data Backup and Recovery:**  Regular backups of critical data will be performed and stored [offsite/in the cloud/etc.]. Procedures for restoring data from backups are documented [location of documentation].
    *   **System Redundancy:**  [Describe any redundant systems, if applicable.  For a small construction company, this might be limited, but could include things like having multiple internet providers or backup power generators.]
    *   **Alternative Work Locations:**  [Describe alternative work arrangements.  This could include working from home, using a temporary office space, or working from a job site.]
    *   **Manual Workarounds:**  [Describe any manual procedures that can be used to perform critical functions if systems are unavailable.  For example, using paper forms instead of digital ones.]
    *   **Communication Plan:**  [Describe how employees will communicate with each other and with clients/vendors during a disruption. This might include using personal cell phones, email, or a designated communication platform.]
    * **Vendor Agreements:** Review and document agreements with key vendors to determine support during disruptions.

### 4.3. Business Continuity Team (BCT)

*   A Business Continuity Team (BCT) is established to manage and coordinate the implementation of this plan.
*   The BCT will consist of the following members:
    *   **Team Leader:** [Owner/CEO/Designated Person] - Overall responsibility for the BCP.
    *   **Operations Lead:** [Office Manager/Project Manager/Designated Person] - Responsible for coordinating the recovery of business operations.
    *   **IT Lead:** [IT Support (Internal or External)] - Responsible for restoring IT systems and data.
*   The BCT may be augmented with additional personnel as needed.

### 4.4. Plan Activation

*   The BCP will be activated by the Team Leader in the event of a significant disruption.
*   The Team Leader will assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action.
*   The BCT will be notified and will begin implementing the recovery strategies.

### 4.5. Testing and Maintenance

*   This plan will be tested at least annually to ensure its effectiveness.
*   Tests may include tabletop exercises, simulations, or full-scale drills.
*   The plan will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently if there are significant changes to the business or the threat landscape.
